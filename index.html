    <h1>The JOAT</h1>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2018: 20% YTD</li>
        <li>2019: 50% YTD</li>
        <li>2020+ 100% YTD</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've had goals that I've achieved in the past.</p>
    <p>I'm in a position today where I can tell myself that...</p>
    <p>I'm here and now because of what I focused on with my work ethic...</p>
    <p>...the 80-hour work weeks for several years have finally paid off.</p>
    <p>I'm also here and now to tell myself that
        <b>trading</b> is my next target.</p>

    <h2>My
        <b>first</b> trade</h2>
    <p>The first stock I bought was $NXT on November 13, 2013, at around EOD.</p>
    <p>18 hours after that, I should have been in my 8:30 AM to 10:00 AM class.</p>
    <p>But, the universe conspired. The professor was absent.</p>
    <p>I went back home, and sealed my profits before it would have turned to dust.</p>
    <img src="./assets/nxt.jpg" />
    <p>I'm not fooling anyone. This was pure luck.</p>

    <h2>After the first trade</h2>
    <p>I had a series of good lucks, one of which was the $TEL trade. I gained P600 with my 25K capital.</p>
    <p>I was on some foums where I've read other trader's results.</p>
    <p>The difference was they got 600k out of their 2.5M capital.</p>
    <p>That's when I mistakenly told myself that what I was doing wouldn't take me anywhere.</p>
    <p>That I would need capital to make trading my primary source of income.</p>
    <p>That's when I initially planned my career shift.</p>
    <p>After spending almost 6 years with my supposedly 4-year course, I was ready to cut my loss</p>
    <p>And dive into the world of IT, for better gains in less time.</p>

    <h2>2014 Q1</h2>
    <p>This season was all about just getting through my god damn thesis to at least mitigate the lost time I've spent in College.</p>
    <p>At least, I'll get out with a diploma.</p>

    <h2>2014 Q2</h2>
    <p>I've spent my time planning for the months and years ahead.</p>
    <p>I settled with the
        <b>Ops</b> side of IT.</p>
    <p>The side of IT that is certification-driven.</p>
    <p>The mindset was I didn't graduate with a technically related degree.</p>
    <p>But, at least, I can be hired based on certifications.</p>

    <h2>2014 Q3</h2>
    <p>Spent this time studying in advance for the bootcamp I planned to attend.</p>

    <h2>2014 Q4</h2>
    <p>Got my certification early, got hired by a company, and was scheduled to start on January 2015.</p>

    <h2>2015</h2>
    <p>This year was hell..</p>
    <p>..A calculated hell.</p>
    <p>It was all planned</p>
    <p>Even if the execution meant destroying my body in the process.</p>

    <h2>2016 Q1</h2>
    <p>The hard work in 2015 paid off.</p>
    <p>My monthly income
        <b>almost tripled</b> by transferring to another company.</p>
    <p>I spent the first few months learning the process of my new job.</p>
    <p>I was considered a top performer until inevitably, I got bored.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>2016 Q2</h2>
    <p>Boredom out of my current job lead me to flirt with another IT fields:
        <b>application development</b>.</p>
    <p>I fantasized about the thought of freedom, and application development seemed to be synonymous with it.</p>
    <p>It seemed to be the career that would be analogous to my proverbial retirement.</p>
    <p>That is, I imagined to be a developer who was working from home.</p>
    <p>And be someone who loves doing his work, such that it stops being considered as a job.</p>
    <p>Application development, was, for me, a field where you can be judged by your results.</p>
    <p>Not by the hours you put in.</p>
    <p>You can create an application that's worth X amount of dollars.</p>
    <p>And it would be up to your capability to finish it either in a month or in a week.</p>

    <h2>2016 Q4</h2>
    <p>Studying application development came to a halt.</p>
    <p>I got distracted with a potential opportunity that would have given me a 60% increase in monthly income.</p>
    <p>I got through the screening process.</p>
    <p>But, for some reason, it did not materialize.</p>

    <h2>2017 Q1</h2>
    <p>I got my sideline as an application developer.</p>
    <p>On weekdays, 9 hours were spent inside the office, plus an average of 2 hours travel time</p>
    <p>11 hours total, with an ideal 8 hours of sleep</p>
    <p>Totalled to around 19 hours of time committed for maintenance.</p>
    <p>The remaining 5 hours were spent for application development</p>

    <h2>2017 Q2</h2>
    <p>The sideline continued, eventually leading to deploying an app to the App Store, Play Store, and an internal CMS for
        my employer.</p>

    <h2>2017 Q3</h2>
    <p>Another potential company transfer presented itself, with an upside of more than doubling my current monthly income.</p>
    <p>But then again, it didn't materialize.</p>
    <p>I was the first to get through their more rigorous technical screening process, as told by a friend.</p>
    <p>But, my asking price may have been considered too steep.</p>
    <p>Maybe that's the problem with knowing my value.</p>
    <p>I know what I can produce.</p>
    <p>I know I shouldn't be judged by the lack of years of experience.</p>

    <h2>2017 Q4</h2>
    <p>Another breakthrough!</p>
    <p>Finally, I got a full time job working from home as a developer.</p>

    <h2>2018 Q1</h2>
    <p>After catching up to the knowledge required to survive in my new job..</p>
    <p>I'm now designing my days again so I'd have time to grow as a
        <b>trader</b>.</p>
